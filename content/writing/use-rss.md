This site has an [RSS feed](/index.xml) available. If you don't know what RSS is, read this:

> A feed is also known as a “web feed” and the technical term (which you’ll see a lot) is “RSS feed.” A feed contains the latest content in a form that your newsreader app understands. (Your newsreader checks the feed automatically, every few hours.)
>
> Tons of websites already have feeds, mostly news sites and blogs. You’ll often see a link at the bottom of the page that says “RSS” or an orange icon similar to this:
>
> Whenever you see a website with a feed, that means you can subscribe to that site.
>
> When you subscribe to only one site, you might say “This doesn’t save me much time.” But when you end up subscribing to 10 or 20, you’ll find that your newsreader becomes your regular place for news and to hear the latest.
>
> You won’t miss content (unlike Facebook, there’s no algorithm deciding to drop content from your feed unless the author pays) and it’s spam-proof. Had enough? Just unsubscribe from the feed.

RSS is an open protocol, which means there are may tools for generating and reading feeds. If you're at all technical, you could probably make your own reader with a little effort. But you don't have to, just google "best RSS readers" to find a list of existing apps that let you get started, often for free.

For writers, RSS is great because you don't have to pay for email delivery software to send people new posts (although if you really want to do that, I recommend Buttondown). Your feed is just another page on the site.
