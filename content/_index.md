description: Joodaloop's recommended starter for a new Hugo site
---

The simplest Hugo site structure I could come up with. It doesn't use themes, any unnecessary folders (data, assets, archetypes), or the other powerful Hugo features like image processing, taxonomies, render hooks etc.

The goal is to make it usable and understandable without you having to read the docs to get started. I use this as a starter myself almost every month and it's been refined to only contain the truly universal files/configs.

More information about this template can be found at the project's [README](https://github.com/joodaloop/hugoloop) page.
